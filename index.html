          <p> <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and
            typesetting industry. Lore Ipsum has been the industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
            unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
            centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
            versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
